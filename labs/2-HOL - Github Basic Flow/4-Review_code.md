- [ðŸ”¨ Hands-on: Review code](#-hands-on-review-code)
  - [Open pull the request and add a single comment](#open-pull-the-request-and-add-a-single-comment)
  - [Incorporate the changes and set PR to autocomplete](#incorporate-the-changes-and-set-pr-to-autocomplete)

> **Note**:

> [Collaborate on code](./3-Collaborate_on_code.md). 

## Open pull the request and add a single comment

1. Open the PR of your partner - you should have received a notification. 
2. Go to the `Files changed` tab 
3. Add a `suggestion` if needed

## Incorporate the changes and set PR to autocomplete

1. Go back to your repo and wait for your partner to complete the comment with the suggestion.
2. Open `Commit suggestion` and verify the commit message title and body. Click `Commit changes`:
